## Running

### Getting Started

More tutorials to come on how to use this as other pieces required to handle authorization are in place!

No configuration is required to serve on `:8200` and metrics at `:8201/metrics` in Prometheus format.

### Docker image

You can download [our docker image `moov/customers`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/customers/) from Docker Hub or use this repository.
