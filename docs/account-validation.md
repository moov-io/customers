# Account Validation

Moov Customers project supports following strategies and vendors to validate accounts:

* micro-deposits validation with Moov [PayGate](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate)
* instant validation with [Plaid](https://plaid.com/products/auth/)

Please, check [API reference](https://moov-io.github.io/customers/api/#post-/customers/{customerID}/accounts/{accountID}/validate) for more details on account validation API.

## Micro-deposits Validation with Moov PayGate

In order to validate Account two micro-depoists under $0.50 will be created with a balanced withdraw. Account validation with micro-deposits strategy consists of two steps:

1. Initiate Account Validation
2. Complete Account Validation

To use this strategy PayGate should be [configured](../README.md#paygate#paygate).

### Configuration

To use this strategy you have to set `PAYGATE_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

### 1. Initiate Account Validation

During this step Moov Customers creates two micro-deposits for the account via Moov [Paygate](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate).

Here is an example of API call to initiate account validation:

```shell
curl "http://localhost:8087/customers/51dd8cdd/accounts/b74d7c51/validate" \
-H "Expect:" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
-d @- <<'EOF'
{
  "strategy":"micro-deposits",
  "vendor":"moov"
}
EOF
```

### 2. Complete Account Validation

To complete account validation, values of created micro-deposits should be provided in the following API call:

```shell
curl "http://localhost:8087/customers/51dd8cdd/accounts/b74d7c51/validate" \
-H "Expect:" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
-d @- <<'EOF'
{
  "strategy":"micro-deposits",
  "vendor":"moov",
  "vendor_request":{
    "micro-deposits":[
      "USD 0.20",
      "USD 0.34"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

## Instant Validation with Plaid

Moov Customers is integrated with [Plaid Auth](https://plaid.com/products/auth/) allowing our users to instantly authenticate bank accounts for payments and set up ACH transfers. See [the configuration](../README.md#configuration) for the Plaid validation strategy.

### How it Works

Moov Customers makes required calls to Plaid API while you have to configure and add [Plaid Link](https://plaid.com/docs-beta/link/) to your application or website. Plaid Link is a drop-in module that provides a secure authentication flow for financial institutions that Plaid supports. Link makes it secure and easy for users to connect their bank accounts to Plaid.

The diagram below shows how account verification with Plaid works:

![moov plaid IAV flow](./images/plaid-flow.svg)

1. Make a request to Initiate Account Validation and get `link_token` for Plaid Link from the response
2. Open Plaid Link with link_token for your customer.
3. Make request to Complete Account Validation by providing `public_token` received from Plaid Link in the onSuccess callback. 

### 1. Initiate Account Validation

Here is an example of API call to initiate account validation:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8087/customers/51dd8cdd/accounts/b74d7c51/validate" \
-H "Expect:" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
-d @- <<'EOF'
{
  "strategy":"instant",
  "vendor":"plaid"
}
EOF
```

The response contains link_token that should be used to open Plaid Link:

```json
{
  "vendor_response":{
    "link_token":"link-sandbox-32771002-45e1-4f9b-93fd-xxxxx",
    "expiration":"2020-08-25T13:07:19Z"
  }
}
```

### 2. Open Plaid Link

Please, find more details on the [Plaid Link documentation website](https://plaid.com/docs-beta/link/). Here we provide a simplified example of how Plaid Link may be used:

```html
<html>
<body>
	<button id="link-button">Verify Account with Plaid</button>
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://cdn.plaid.com/link/v2/stable/link-initialize.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var handler;

		// 1. send POST request to your app server (e.g., /verify)
		$.post('/verify', {}, function (data) {
			// 2. Open Plaid Link with link_token from Moov Customers
			handler = Plaid.create({
				token: data.link_token,
				onSuccess: function (public_token) {
					// 3. send public_token your app server
					$.ajax({
						type: "PUT",
						url: "/verify",
						data: {
							public_token: public_token,
						},
						success: function (data) {
							console.log("Verification result: ", data);
						},
					});
				},
			});
		});

		$('#link-button').on('click', function (e) {
			handler.open();
		});
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Complete Account Validation

When you get public_token to your app server from Plaid Link you can compelte account validation by making API request to Moov Customers. Here is an example of API call:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8087/customers/51dd8cdd/accounts/b74d7c51/validate" \
-H "Expect:" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
-d @- <<'EOF'
{
  "strategy":"instant",
  "vendor":"plaid",
  "vendor_request":{
    "public_token":"public-sandbox-59eb4718-93d8-41a0-a338-xxxxxxx"
  }
}
EOF
```

The response with validation result:

```json
{
  "vendor_response":{
    "result":"validated"
  }
}
```
## Instant Validation with MX

Moov Customers is integrated with [MX Platform API](https://www.mx.com/products/platform-api/) allowing our users to instantly authenticate bank accounts for payments and set up ACH transfers. See [the configuration](../README.md#configuration) for the MX validation strategy.

### How it Works

Moov Customers makes required calls to MX Platform API while you have to configure and add [MX Connect widget](https://atrium.mx.com/docs#mx-connect-widget) by embedding it in a [website with an iframe](https://atrium.mx.com/docs#embedding-in-a-website) or a mobile application with a [WebView](https://atrium.mx.com/docs#embedding-in-webviews). MX Connect is a ready-made and embeddable application that allows you to quickly perform account verification of your customers.

The diagram below shows how account verification with MX works:

![moov MX IAV flow](./images/mx-flow.svg)

1. Make a request to Initiate Account Validation and get `connect_widget_url` for MX Connect widget from the response
2. Open MX Connect for your customer.
3. Make request to Complete Account Validation by providing `user_guid` and `member_guid` received from MX Connect in the onSuccess callback. 

### 1. Initiate Account Validation

Here is an example of API call to initiate account validation:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8087/customers/51dd8cdd/accounts/b74d7c51/validate" \
-H "Expect:" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
-d @- <<'EOF'
{
  "strategy":"instant",
  "vendor":"mx"
}
EOF
```

The response contains connect_widget_url that should be used to open MX Connect:

```json
{
  "vendor_response":{
    "connect_widget_url":"https://int-widgets.moneydesktop.com/xxxxxx"
  }
}
```

### 2. Open MX Connect Widget

Please, find more details on [how to setup and configure MX Connect](https://atrium.mx.com/docs#mx-connect-widget). Here we provide a simplified example of how MX Connect widget may be used:

```html
<html>
<body>
	<button id="link-button">Verify Account with MX</button>
	<p>Select MX bank and use test_atrium/password or test_atrium/challenge with "correct" as MFA answer</p>
	<div id="verifyAccount"></div>
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://atrium.mx.com/connect.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var handler;

		// 1. send POST request to your app server (e.g., /verify)
		$.post('/verify', {}, function (data) {
			console.log(data, data.connect_widget_url);

			// 2.1 Configure MX Connect Widget
			handler = new MXConnect({
				config: {
					is_mobile_webview: false,
				},
				id: "verifyAccount",
				url: data.connect_widget_url,
				onSuccess: function (data) {
					// 3. send data including user_guid and memeber_guid to your app server
					$.ajax({
						type: "PUT",
						url: "/verify",
						data: data,
						success: function (data) {
							console.log("Verification result: ", data);
						},
					});
				},
			});
		});

		$('#link-button').on('click', function (e) {
			// 2.2 Open MX Connect Widget
			handler.load();
		});
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 3. Complete Account Validation

When you get `user_guid` and `member_guid` to your app server from MX Connect can compelte account validation by making API request to Moov Customers. Here is an example of API call:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8087/customers/51dd8cdd/accounts/b74d7c51/validate" \
-H "Expect:" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
-d @- <<'EOF'
{
  "strategy":"instant",
  "vendor":"plaid",
  "vendor_request":{
    "user_guid":"USR-d6a55e69-8711-4b21-b594-2538551231231",
    "member_guid":"MBR-1c38dad9-e699-4f01-baf7-d91231231231"
  }
}
EOF
```

The response with validation result

```json
{
  "vendor_response":{
    "result":"validated"
  }
}
```
