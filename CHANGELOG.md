## v0.5.0 (Unreleased)

Customers v0.5.0 comes with several new features including Customer searching/filtering, additional Instant Account Validation strategies, and a reformed model for separating models.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

We now require the `X-Organization` HTTP header on requests. This is to enforce isolation of models for multi-tenant installs. The value can be a free-form string so a UUID, random string, or other identifier can be supplied.

- Accounts require HolderName (legal name on the financial account)
- ./pkg/client and ./pkg/admin package moved from the root package
- Database migrations use golang-migrate and so require copying the old data into new tables

ADDITIONS

- accounts: `instant` validation can be performed with Plaid or MX.
- api,client: expose institution details on accounts
- accounts: return InstitutionDetails next to routing number
- cmd/server: add an endpoint for searching customers
- customers: added search filter params `status`, `type` and pagination with `skip` and `count`
- accounts: perform OFAC search of HolderName
- approval: return 'blocked' boolean from OFAC search

IMPROVEMENTS

- accounts: return updated model after updating status
- customers: accept yyyy-mm-dd formatted birthDates
- customers: using base http GetSkipAndCount() to get skip and count from request
- customers: perform the OFAC search inline of creation flow
- accounts: reject duplicate accounts for a customer
- cmd/server: read OFAC_ENDPOINT or WATCHMAN_ENDPOINT
- customers: send back an array of search results, not null
- database/mysql: fix migration for customer type
- docs: reference ./cmd/genkey/ for [local secret keys](docs/configuration.md#local-filesystem-local)
- fed: support debugging API calls
- paygate: support debugging API calls
- watchman: support debugging API calls
- api,client: mark SSN as optional on CreateCustomer

BUG FIXEs

- accounts: return an empty array if no accounts are found
- cmd/server: return 404 if customer isn't found
- customers: render nil birthDate as null instead of time.Zero
- customers: save customer type and marshal it back
